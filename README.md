# AoC-2022

First try of JavaScript via https://adventofcode.com/

Never tried JS. Has been interesting...

TODO: 
- [] I mixed up Day 1 part one and two - does it matter?
- [] Lots to learn. 
- [] Especially the functional stuff .map .reduce .filter etc and the little functions x => x+1. 
- [] Get a decent file handle: I just yanked the fs thingymabob off the interweb and have no idea what a promise is. 
- [] What is a promise?
- [] Tidy all this code up. 
- [] Add tests and guards etc. 
- [] Consider performance and merits of different approaches. 
- [] Would be cute to make a visual for the Day 5 supply stacks.
- [] Complete thePrimeagen Fem course on data structures and algorithms.
- [] Convert code to TS.
